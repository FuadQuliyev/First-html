    The design of the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max is identical to older iPhone models, such as the iPhone 12 Pro and 13 Pro. The iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max are available in four colors: Silver, Space Black, Gold and Deep Purple. Deep Purple replaced the Sierra Blue color used on the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.
    It is the final iPhone model in the exterior design to come with the stainless steel form factor along with the gold color option. The gold color option has been replaced by the new natural titanium color option following the launch of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.

    <h1><em>Camera</em></h1>
    <em>
    The camera sensors and lenses on the main and ultra-wide cameras have been upgraded. The main camera features a new 48-megapixel quad-pixel sensor that is 65% larger than the one on the iPhone 13 Pro. It defaults to 12 megapixels, achieved through a process called pixel binning. However, users can access the full capabilities of the sensor by activating the ProRAW feature. The ultra-wide camera features a new larger 12-megapixel sensor that has 100% focus pixels. The lens has also been improved for optical clarity and features a larger aperture.
    The new camera system also incorporates a new "Photonic Engine" for improved image and video quality. Additionally, the video feature now includes Action Mode, which offers video stabilization that can be accessed through the top right corner of the screen. The resolution of the picture can now be customized. The TrueDepth camera has gained autofocus and a larger aperture. It is also capable of focusing on multiple subjects simultaneously.
