    The design of the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max is identical to older iPhone models, such as the iPhone 12 Pro and 13 Pro. The iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max are available in four colors: Silver, Space Black, Gold and Deep Purple. Deep Purple replaced the Sierra Blue color used on the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.
    It is the final iPhone model in the exterior design to come with the stainless steel form factor along with the gold color option. The gold color option has been replaced by the new natural titanium color option following the launch of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.
